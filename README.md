# Shoot-em Down
 The goal of this game prototype is to score the maximum number of points by clicking on opponents(LMB).
 
 At the beginning the player is given a supply of points (10) and a time (30) seconds.
 For one enemy, the player receives (1) point, if the player (5) times in a row hits the enemies without a miss, then a first-aid kit(+3 time) will appear on the screen.
 If the enemy was not neutralized and went off the edge of the screen, then the player earns (-1) point.
 
 The game ends if either time or points run out.
